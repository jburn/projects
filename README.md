# projects
random projects and code

miinaharava: A simple minesweeper made as a first ever project for a programming course in uni. 
Has minor bugs and flaws but mostly functional. Also documentation is very little to none.

pocket_calculator: A simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide and also raise to the power of any number.
No known bugs, but I might've missed something along the way. Added some documentation too.
